# OntoUML Archive Model Repository

The OntoUML Archive Model Repository is a initiative of members of the OntoUML community in order to investigate the usage of the OntoUML language. The main purpose of this work is to identify how users build models in OntoUML and what are the improvement opportunities for the language and the whole ontology-driven conceptual modeling ecossystem around it.

As a secondary result, we intend to offer to the OntoUML community a curated repository of models on which researchers may rely on when developing new solutions or studies.

Each folder in this repository contains an OntoUML ontology represented in [Ontology Archive](https://github.com/OntoUML/OntoUML-Archive), a textual language that allows the description of basic visual features in OntoUML diagrams. In addition, each folder contains automatically generated [PlantUML](http://plantuml.com) diagrams which are views of the related published model.

The OntoUML Archive language is built with the sole purpose of describing published models in a easy maner allow their persistence and processment while accomodating eventual inconsistencies in respect to OntoUML definitions. In fact, we expect that the very incosistencies between published models and the language's definitons will be a usefull source of improvement opportunities.

It is important to highlight that OntoUML Archive is NOT INTENDED AS A ONTOLOGY-DRIVEN CONCEPTUAL MODELING LANGUAGE. Thus, it does not have the proper tooling assistence important for the activity of ODCM.
